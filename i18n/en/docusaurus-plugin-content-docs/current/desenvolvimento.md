This integration allows us to monitor the flow of people, analyze customer behavior, and generate visual data that enriches restaurant management.

- **Azure**: We have implemented Azure as the authentication solution for HAPPDINE, utilizing Single Sign-On (SSO) to provide a simplified and secure login experience for the administrator. With SSO, the administrator can access the platform using their existing corporate credentials, eliminating the need to manage multiple passwords and increasing system security. The integration with Azure enables robust and scalable authentication. This approach not only improves the administrator experience, but also ensures that data security is a priority, allowing HAPPDINE to operate efficiently and reliably in an enterprise setting.

### Authentication Implementation
#### Front-End

- Development of the administrator login screen using React and Vite;

- Seamless integration with the API provided by the backend for administrator authentication.

#### Back-End

- Robust implementation of routes and authentication logic with Spring Boot: We have developed a solid framework to manage routes and authentication logic in HAPPDINE, using the advanced features of Spring Boot. This implementation provides strict control of access to different areas of the application.

- Creating secure endpoints with SSO: We establish secure endpoints that utilize Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality to process administrator login requests efficiently and securely. This approach minimizes exposure to vulnerabilities by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive information and perform administrative actions on the platform.

- Generation of authentication tokens with SSO: We have implemented a system for creating authentication tokens using SSO, ensuring that administrator sessions are managed securely and effectively. These tokens are essential for validating the user's identity in each request, offering an additional layer of security and facilitating continuous interaction with the application. With this strategy, we ensure an agile user experience, without compromising data protection and the integrity of the HAPPDINE platform.

## Project Structuring
- **Front-End**: We implemented a meticulous organization of the source code in HAPPDINE, structuring it into reusable components, pages, and services. This approach not only promotes maintainability and scalability of the front-end, but also facilitates collaboration between developers, allowing new team members to quickly understand the project architecture. Reusable components ensure that common functionality is implemented consistently, reducing code duplication and increasing development efficiency. In addition, this organization allows for faster updates and improvements, contributing to a more fluid and responsive user experience.

- **Back-End**: The HAPPDINE back-end structure strictly follows Spring Boot design standards, organizing the code into distinct layers: DTO (Data Transfer Object), MODEL, CONTROLLER, SECURITY, and REPOSITORY. This organization ensures code cohesion and clarity, facilitating application maintenance and expansion. Separating responsibilities between these layers allows for better management of business logic, security validation, and database interactions, resulting in a more robust and easy-to-understand system. Using best practices for back-end development ensures that HAPPDINE is scalable and capable of meeting growing user demands, while maintaining optimized performance and efficient integration with the front-end.


## Workflow

- Git: Git is a distributed version control system widely used to manage software projects. We use Git repositories to store HAPPDINE files, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate as a team, and maintain a detailed history of modifications. With features such as branches, merges, and reverts, Git offers flexible version management and makes conflict resolution easier. Its distributed nature allows for offline work and synchronization with remote repositories, making it an essential tool for modern software development.

## Development Environment

### Tools and Integration

We use **Vite** as our rapid development environment for the frontend, leveraging its efficiency to build modern applications with a fast and agile development experience. Vite allows for instant hot-reloading and build optimizations, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive interfaces.
