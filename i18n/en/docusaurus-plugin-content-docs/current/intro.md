# Overview
HAPPDINE is the key to a hassle-free Bosch corporate restaurant experience with an optimized service flow! With a customer-centric approach and operational simplicity, our goal is to transform the day-to-day life of the Robert Bosch restaurant at the Campinas/SP plant, ensuring efficiency for the management team and an intuitive platform for users. 

## Objective 
HAPPDINE aims to simplify the management and experience of the Bosch corporate restaurant. With features that allow you to create, modify and monitor queues, menus, feedback and notifications, the platform guarantees intuitive and efficient interaction. From restaurant administration to real-time queue monitoring, each tool has been designed to make the process accessible and straightforward for everyone using the system. 

## Benefits  
- AI monitoring - HAPPDINE's AI monitoring technology uses advanced algorithms to observe and analyze the flow of people in real time. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the system is able to identify the flow of queues and optimize the management of the space, generating data that helps organize the restaurant and continuously improve the user experience. 

- Real-Time Charts â€“ HAPPDINE offers real-time charts that show essential data for restaurant management, such as movement times, queue monitoring and the favorite menu of the day. These charts facilitate immediate monitoring of operations, allowing managers to make quick and informed decisions, guaranteeing efficient service and a more satisfactory user experience. 

- ChatBot - The chatbot functionality integrated into HAPPDINE provides fast and practical communication for users, with a simplified button-based interface. Through the chatbot and the virtual assistant Sofia (hand-developed by the team), customers can access information about menus, opening hours and ask questions about the restaurant in an intuitive way, without having to type and with voice accessibility. This feature makes interaction more agile and personalized, meeting users' needs in a practical and direct way.

## Vision
Our vision with HAPPDINE is to transform the Bosch corporate restaurant experience into a model of efficiency, where queue management, menu updates, centralization and information search flow in an intuitive and accessible way for everyone. HAPPDINE is for everyone who uses the restaurant, not only employees, but also third parties, suppliers and everyone who has access to the restaurant. We want the platform to be recognized for its ability to improve users' daily lives and facilitate administrators' operations, promoting an integrated experience that raises the standard of corporate services.
